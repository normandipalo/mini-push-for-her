# Mini Push with Hindisght Experience Replay
A mini pushing environment to experiment with Hindsight Experience Replay.
The environment is a grid world where an agent has to push a block in a goal position. The rewards are sparse, thus general DRL algorithms such as DDPG have a hard time learning to solve the task. If we add Hindsight Experience Replay, the task is solved quickly. The notebook is on Google Colaboratory allowing to experimetn with it.
